I have done a research about several cities in Germany. This project provides different information such as approximate salaries, expenses, air quality, unemployment rate etc, that information people are usually interested in, when they decide to which city would they like to live and work in. I won't consider the best city in Germany, because each of them have their own individual characteristics and you need to figure it out which one suit you.

* Germany_analysis.xlsx - collected data from various sources.
* Python_calculation.ipynb - calculations in Python, getting insights.
* Final_data.xlsx - export from Python for the following Power BI report.
* Final_result_EN.pbix - Power BI report in English language.
* Endergebnis_DE.pbix - Power BI report in German language.
