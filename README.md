I have conducted research on several cities in Germany. This project provides various information, such as approximate salaries, expenses, air quality, and unemployment rates. This information is usually of interest to people when they are deciding which city they would like to live and work in. I won't claim that there is a single best city in Germany, as each of them has its own individual characteristics. You need to figure out which one suits you.
