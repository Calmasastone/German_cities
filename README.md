I have done a research about several cities in Germany. This project provides different information such as approximate salaries, expenses, air quality, unemployment rate etc, so that information people are usually interested in, when they decide to which city would they like to live and work in. 
* Germany_analysis.xlsx - collected data from various sources
* Python_calculation.ipynb - calculations in Python, getting insights 
* Final_data.xlsx - export from Python for making Power BI dashboards
* Final_result.pbix - Power BI dashboards
